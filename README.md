# Tableau

## My first experience with Tableau

Tableau is very good software for visualizing and analyzing data.

Here, I created three different dashboards using the Tableau free-public software.  Using those dashboards we can compare the COVID-19 data till the 30th May 2021.
It contains the three different dashboards:  
> 1. Cases-Deaths: It shows the total cases and total deaths per continent as well as per region.  
> 2. Comparison: It's comparing the ICU patients and hospitalized patients per specific region. Through this dashboard, it's become easy to know the severity of the COVID-19.  
> 3. Vaccine: It's providing the data regarding vaccinations in the specific continent, the number of people vaccinated, and a comparison of that.  Using this we can get an idea of how many people are vaccinated.

Using this tableau software, we can analyze the different data and understand them very easily without wasting too much time.
